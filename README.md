# cardsWithOOD

**Name**: Michael Miralles
**Date**: 6/16/2025

## Description
This Java project is a super simple card game. The original code was provided as a template and I made several changes from there in order to improve gameplay and interactivity.

## Feature(s) Added
- Created a complete `Card` class, equipped with constructors, mutators/accessors, and even `toString()`.
- Added score calculation based on the player's hand total.
- Included an interactive **hand sorting** feature that allows the player to sort their hand by value or name using Java's `Collections.sort()` with a custom `Comparator`.
- Incluced detailed comments through the code explaining functionality.

## Files
- `CardGame.java` - Where the main game logic is in.
- `Card.java` - Defines the structure and behaviors of a card.
- `cards.txt` - Deck of cards, data was used to load suits/name/values/pictures.
